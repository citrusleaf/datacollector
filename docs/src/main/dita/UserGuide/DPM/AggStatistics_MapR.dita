 <title>Write Statistics to MapR Streams</title>
 <shortdesc>When you write statistics to MapR Streams, <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
        effectively adds a MapR Streams Producer destination to the pipeline that you are
        configuring. <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>
        automatically generates and runs a system pipeline for the job. The system pipeline reads
        the statistics from MapR Streams, and then aggregates and sends the statistics to <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>. </shortdesc>

        <p>When you write statistics to MapR Streams, you define the topic to write to. You also
            configure the partition strategy. The pipeline passes data to partitions in the MapR
            Streams topic based on the partition strategy that you choose. You can add additional
            MapR Streams configuration properties as needed. </p>
